# Portfolio


# Objectives

1. Create a bare bones HTML page for your future portfolio page
2. Make some decisions about whether you're going to use a framework, and if so, include a CDN link to that framework.
3. Spend some time thinking of a color palette you would like to use. Try developing some from images. Try this site: https://www.canva.com/color-palette/ 
4. Deploy to Github Pages - this is the way we did project 1. NO BACKEND!!
5. Choose your best project between P1 and P2 - set aside an hour or two to dedicate to refactoring. DRY out the code, remove commented out code, etc.
