			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Flexible and motivated, I've lead small teams and trained new hires. My natural positivity and team oriented mindset lends me to be a natural leader focused on growing myself and the people around me. If I am not helping others I ask myself "why am I doing what I'm doing?" Communication is the key to my method, I've found that most of the time people simply want to be heard. I certainly haven't seen everything and someone's perspective may show me something I couldn't have otherwise found. Proactivity is the best preventitive action in my expierence, many times coming in early and putting in that little bit of extra care has made all the difference. I never hope to be the strongest member of my team; I hope to pull my wieght, alittle extra, and bring the rest of the team up with me.</p>

			<h3>Goals and Values</h3>
			<p>I enjoy this work, solving problems and giving reliable products to people. Things that make lives easier. one the biggest things I look for is Growth. Short term; I want the space to learn and grow in a team enviroment where I can teach others and others can teach me. Long term; beng able to move up and lead teams. Lead teams of leaders and enevitable world domination. I think that is what most people want too.</p>

			<h3>Approach</h3>
			<p>Problem solving is about mindset. The mindset that I have found to lend itself the most to this is Growth mindset. I love reading article on ideas new to me then turning around and trying new things. I often revisit old project and try new ways to do the same thing to see what works best. I don't have all the answers but I certianly am will to try enough things to find something that will work.</p>
